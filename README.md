# Passport OAuth 2.0 Refresh

An add-on to the [Passport](http://passportjs.org) authentication library to provide a simple way to refresh your OAuth 2.0 access tokens.

## Installation

```
npm install passport-oauth2-refresh --save
```

## Usage

When setting up your passport strategies, add a call to `refresh.use()` after `passport.use()`.

An example, using the Facebook strategy:

``` js
var passport = require('passport'),
  , refresh = require('passport-oauth2-refresh')
  , FacebookStrategy = require('passport-facebook').Strategy;

var strategy = new FacebookStrategy({
  clientID: FACEBOOK_APP_ID,
  clientSecret: FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET,
  callbackURL: "http://www.example.com/auth/facebook/callback"
},
function(accessToken, refreshToken, profile, done) {
  // Make sure you store the refreshToken somewhere!
  User.findOrCreate(..., function(err, user) {
    if (err) { return done(err); }
    done(null, user);
  });
});

passport.use(strategy);
refresh.use(strategy);
```

When you need to refresh the access token, call `requestNewAccessToken()`:

``` js
var refresh = require('passport-oauth2-refresh');
refresh.requestNewAccessToken('facebook', 'some_refresh_token', function(err, accessToken, refreshToken) {
  // You have a new access token, store it in the user object,
  // or use it to make a new request.
  // `refreshToken` may or may not exist, depending on the strategy you are using.
  // You probably don't need it anyway, as according to the OAuth 2.0 spec,
  // it should be the same as the initial refresh token.

});

```

## Works with

- OAuth2
- OpenID Connect - see [Passport OpenID Connect](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-openidconnect) 

## Examples

- See [issue #1](https://github.com/fiznool/passport-oauth2-refresh/issues/1) for an example of how to refresh a token when requesting data from the Google APIs.

## Why?

Passport is a library which doesn't deal in implementation-specific details. From the author:

> Passport is a library for authenticating requests, and only that. It is not going to get involved in anything that is specific to OAuth, or any other authorization protocol.

Fair enough. Hence, this add-on was born as a way to help deal with refreshing OAuth 2.0 tokens.

It is particularly useful when dealing with Google's OAuth 2.0 implementation, which expires access tokens after 1 hour.
